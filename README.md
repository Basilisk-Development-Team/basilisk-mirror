# Basilisk web browser

This is the source code for the Basilisk web browser, an independent browser
derived from Firefox/Mozilla community code. The source tree is laid out in a
"comm-central" style configuration where only the code specific to Basilisk is
kept in this repository.

The shared Unified XUL Platform source code is referenced here as a git
submodule contained in the `platform` directory and is required to build the
application.

## Getting the platform sub-module
`git submodule init && git submodule update`

## Documentation
See the [Basilisk Wiki](https://repo.palemoon.org/Basilisk-Dev/Basilisk/wiki) for information regarding building Basilisk.
